# Repository of Lee and Han (2023)

## Summary
Lee and Han (2023) propose robust GLMs studied by Huber (1967), White (1982) and McCullagh (1983) as a powerful and robust method for performing differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. This page contains the code used to carry out the analysis in the paper.
