# Repository of Lee and Han (2023)

## Summary
Lee and Han (2023) proposes robust GLMs studied by Huber (1967), White (1982) and McCullagh (1983) as a powerful and robust method for performing differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. This page contains the code used to carry out the analysis in the paper.
Additionally, the `Supplementary` folder contains example codes for users who want to adapt the proposed appraoch to their analysis pipeline.

## Examples currently provided

1. statsmodels (Python)
2. fixest (R)
3. sandwich (R)
